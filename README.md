# 🌐 ChainPing – Multi-Chain RPC Monitoring Dashboard

**ChainPing** is a real-time monitoring tool designed to help Web3 developers, infrastructure teams, and node operators track the **health, uptime, and latency of blockchain RPC endpoints** across multiple networks.

## 🚀 Why ChainPing?

In decentralized applications, **reliable RPC endpoints** are critical. Slow or failing endpoints can lead to transaction errors, poor user experience, and degraded dApp performance. **ChainPing** solves this by giving you instant visibility into the status of your RPC providers.

## 🧠 Use Cases

- ✅ Detect slow or unresponsive RPC endpoints early  
- 🔍 Compare RPC performance across chains and providers  
- 📉 Optimize backend infrastructure for reliability and speed  
- 🔔 Enable faster incident response for DevOps and Web3 teams

## 🔧 Features

- 📡 **Real-time RPC latency and status checks**
- 🌐 **Multi-chain support** (Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and more)
- 📊 **Chain-specific health metrics** at a glance
- 🛠️ **Self-hostable dashboard** for internal or public monitoring
- 🔁 **Auto-polling** of endpoints for up-to-date data
